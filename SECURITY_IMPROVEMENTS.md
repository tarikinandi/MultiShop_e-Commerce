# IdentityServer Integration Security Improvements

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. **Standardized Configuration**
- ✅ Fixed IdentityServerUrl consistency across all APIs (standardized to HTTPS)
- ✅ Catalog API: Changed from HTTP to HTTPS for secure communication

### 2. **Enhanced Token Validation Security**
- ✅ **Order API**: Enabled proper token validation
  - ValidateAudience: true
  - ValidateIssuer: true
  - Added reasonable ClockSkew (5 minutes)
  - Environment-based HTTPS requirement

- ✅ **Cargo API**: Applied same security improvements
  - Removed development-only disabled validations
  - Enhanced security posture

### 3. **Policy-Based Authorization Implementation**
- ✅ **Catalog API**: Implemented granular scope-based authorization
  - `CatalogReadPermission`: GET operations
  - `CatalogFullPermission`: POST, PUT, DELETE operations
  
- ✅ **Discount API**: Added policy-based authorization
  - `DiscountFullPermission`: All operations

- ✅ **Order API**: Added authorization policies
  - `OrderFullPermission`: All operations

- ✅ **Cargo API**: Added authorization policies
  - `CargoFullPermission`: All operations

### 4. **Swagger OAuth2 Integration**
- ✅ Added OAuth2 security configuration to all APIs
- ✅ Configured client credentials flow for testing
- ✅ Enabled scope-based testing in Swagger UI

### 5. **CORS Configuration**
- ✅ Added comprehensive CORS policies to all APIs
- ✅ Supports cross-origin requests for microservices architecture

### 6. **Secret Management Enhancement**
- ✅ Moved hard-coded client secrets to configuration
- ✅ IdentityServer now reads secrets from appsettings.json
- ✅ Improved security by eliminating hard-coded values

### 7. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- ✅ Added custom authentication error handling middleware (Catalog API)
- ✅ Provides structured error responses for authentication/authorization failures
- ✅ Includes proper HTTP status codes and descriptive messages

## Security Improvements Applied

### Before:
```
❌ HTTP/HTTPS inconsistency
❌ Disabled token validation (ValidateAudience: false, ValidateIssuer: false)
❌ Basic [Authorize] attributes only
❌ Hard-coded secrets in source code
❌ No CORS configuration
❌ Limited error handling
```

### After:
```
✅ Consistent HTTPS configuration
✅ Proper token validation enabled
✅ Granular scope-based authorization policies
✅ Configuration-based secret management
✅ CORS support for microservices
✅ Enhanced error handling with structured responses
✅ Swagger OAuth2 integration for testing
```

## Authentication Flow

1. **Client Authentication**: Client applications authenticate with IdentityServer using client credentials
2. **Token Issuance**: IdentityServer issues JWT tokens with appropriate scopes
3. **API Protection**: APIs validate tokens and enforce scope-based policies
4. **Authorization**: Each endpoint requires specific permissions based on operation type

## Scope Definitions

- `CatalogReadPermission`: Read access to catalog resources
- `CatalogFullPermission`: Full access to catalog resources
- `DiscountFullPermission`: Full access to discount resources
- `OrderFullPermission`: Full access to order resources
- `CargoFullPermission`: Full access to cargo resources

## Client Roles

- **Visitor**: Limited access to discount operations
- **Manager**: Read and write access to catalog resources
- **Admin**: Full access to all resources and scopes

## Testing

All APIs build successfully and are configured for secure authentication and authorization. The integration provides:

- Secure token-based authentication
- Granular permission controls
- Proper error handling
- Developer-friendly testing through Swagger
- Production-ready security configurations
